Welcome to my GitHub! I am a fourth year computer science student at McMaster University.

I am currently looking for full time work starting in the summer of 2023.

Most of my coding experience is in Python, Java and C++, and I am in the process of learning more about web development in my spare time, which has lead to the creation of my own website: evan.desjardine.ca. Feel free to reach out if you are interested in any of the projects I have made or just want to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/evan-desjardine" target="_blank">connect!</a></p>
